# About

This report contains a description of the methods and analysis used by the GBAD's (Global Burden of Animal Disease) 
PPS (Population and Production Systems) theme to obtain an estimate of the 
global economic value of livestock.   This was done using a total economic value approach, 
similar to approaches taken in various different economic fields. 

The purpose of this section of GBADs is to establish as baseline valuation which 
can be used in downstream calculations to determine the economic cost of different 
animal diseases present in different livestock types worldwide. 


Currently, this project has only looked at estimating a countries Livestock and 
aquaculture TEV for over the range 1990-2020. This is due to the lack of economic 
data, such as livestock prices, which is available on a global basis prior to this 
point. As, due to inconsistencies with currencies and exchange rates, comparisons
across countries are much less trustworthy for older data. 


## Progress Report (Last Updated 2021-10-11)

The following section contains brief descriptions of the current progress
that has been achieved on a variety of different items in relation to the 
estimation. 

October
: - [ ] Compare estimates derived from FAO and OIE data to data sourced from national statistics. 
: - [ ] Produce confidence estimates of the valuations
: - [ ] Report data quality issues
: - [ ] Source US Dairy data ^[https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/dairy-data/dairy-data/]
    
October
: -	[ ] List data gaps as detailed as possible
: -	[x] AS2: Price data (unit price) missing for number of years/countries, e.g., India, Ethiopia, other which countries (please list them all) (Section \@ref(data-AS2-fao-price))
: -	[x] AS2: Live aquaculture biomass (Section \@ref(data-AS2-fao-fish))
: -	[x] O1: Any data missing – volume/value? (Section \@ref(data-O1-fao))
: -	[x] O2: (Price data) for secondary outputs (e.g., skins) - for which countries? (Section \@ref(data-O2-fao-issues))
: - [ ] Missing time series data (interpolation?), which countries/years are mostly affected?
: - [ ] List extensions that could be done with more time 
: - [ ] Use of FAO export data and potential assumptions when using this data to derive price values for a county’s live animal stock

November/Decemeber
: - [ ] Scenario estimations (year with most data available globally) 
: - [ ] Scenario to compare volume biomass & value for livestock and aquatic animals separately (proportional development?)
: - [ ] AS2+O1 = total value of production and output (what was the issue with that? 80% hurdle?)
: - [ ] AS2 = all up (update)
: - [ ] AS2 = cattle, sheep, gout, poultry (update)
: - [ ] O1 = all up (update)
: - [ ] O1 = fish, meat, milk, eggs (update)
: - [ ] AS2 all up /capita (update)
: - [ ] O1 all up/capita (update)
: - [ ] (GDP – to be confirmed if we need that)
: - [ ] (Scenarios using different biomass conversion factors to be confirmed after meeting with other GBADs teams)
: -  -  Issues related to different conversion factors are detailed in section \@ref(data-AS2-fao-liveweights)


December
: - [ ] Document scenario estimation including data sources

Todo
: - Automate reports, looking at time series, price vs biomass, prices vs animal products, liveweight prices, 

## Data Sources {#data-sources}

This section contains a variety of different data sources we are in the progress 
of accessing or are planning to in the future. 



### India {#data-sources-india}

Some reports for data on India are available online ^[[India Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying](https://dahd.nic.in/animal-husbandry-statistics)]. 
These are pdf reports which contain quite detailed data over the last 10 years on livestock populations, 
and production, but don't appear to include live weight prices. Only value added 
calculations, which may not be useful in calculating the value of animal stock present in a country.
There are also derived statistics of value added by sector on the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation [website](http://www.mospi.nic.in/publication/national-accounts-statistics-2021). 
However, they only include the value added. 


<div class="alert alert-info">
  <strong>Note:</strong> Price data for India could potential be reconstructed using the 
  producer prices index reported by the FAO in the PP table. However,in some cases  they appear to be constant across live weight prices 
  within some years. 
</div>

### United States {#data-sources-usa}

Data for the Unites States Department of Agriculture (USD) 
from the National Agricultural Statistics Service is available [here](https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/api)

#### Dairy Data 
Data from the USDA on diary products, as well as prices of livestock outputs 
are available from [this](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/dairy-data) link.

Prices can be found [here](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/meat-price-spreads/)


## To Consider

### Currencies

<div class "alert alerg-info">
<strong> For Peggy: </strong> One thing to consider is what currency that GBADs would like results reported in. 
The FAO has data reported in LCU, SLC (constant/current), USD (constant/current)
as well as International dollars and Producer Price Indices. 
In cases where only one is available, there must be an agreed upon form of conversion
to what is the most appropriate unit to present and compare results in, 
and a a methodology for eliminating values should be decided upon.
