# Description: This file takes as input the current
# FAOSTAT Country Codes and produces a subset of these
# codes based which are used for all subsequent analysis
#
#  Because of the importance of the more recent values in this
#  analysis, the ISO3 codes that will be used are the current set
#  197 member states of the United Nations.  This is done to avoid any
#  sort of change in allocation/double counting.
#
# - Note: these codes contain multiple Chinese regions
#   which are subset to make sure that china is not double
#   counted. China will always be mapped to CHN
#
# The input code file is contained in
#  - data/codes/FAOSTAT_Country_Codes.Rds
#
# Output:
# - data/output/codes/faostat_iso3_country_codes.parquet
#
# These locations are contained in the project configuration file
# - conf/config.yml
# and the dependencies are contained within the Makefile recipe
# to rebuild the output file.
