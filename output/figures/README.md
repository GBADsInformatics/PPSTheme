# Figure Specifications 

Currently, the manuscript authors have initially targeted the following journals for publication. 
 
- Nature Food 


## Nature Food

Specifications are identified in the following urls:

- [AIP and Formatting](https://www.nature.com/natfood/submission-guidelines/aip-and-formatting)
- [NRJs guide to preparing final-artwork](https://www.nature.com/documents/NRJs-guide-to-preparing-final-artwork.pdf)

### Specifications

#### Images

- Image Citations: Fig.1
- Figures have minimum resolution of 300 dpi and saved at maximum width of 180 mm
- Use a 5–7 pt san serif font for standard text labelling and Symbol font for Greek characters.
- Use scale bars, not magnification factors, and include error bars where appropriate.
- Do not flatten labelling or scale/error bars onto images – un-editable or low-resolution images are two of the most common reasons for delay in manuscript preparation.

#### Figure legends

 - Include a brief title for each figure with a short description of each panel cited in sequence.
 - Ensure the legend does not exceed the word limit of the article type.
